    <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            Computer Science Engineering student at Tecnológico de Monterrey with a strong passion for programming,
            problem-solving, and technology. I enjoy coding in Python and C++, constantly seeking to build projects that enhance
            both my knowledge and the community. I'm particularly interested in developing software, web applications, and
            machine learning models that can make a real impact. Beyond programming, I'm an avid gamer and love exploring
            how technology shapes interactive experiences. I also strive to be involved in my community, using my skills to
            contribute to meaningful projects that address real-world challenges.
